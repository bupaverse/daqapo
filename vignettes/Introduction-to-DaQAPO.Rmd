Process mining techniques generate valuable insights in business processes using automatically generated process execution data. However, despite the extensive opportunities that process mining techniques provide, the garbage in - garbage out principle still applies. Data quality issues are widespread in real-life data and can generate misleading results when used for analysis purposes. Currently, there is no systematic way to perform data quality assessment on process-oriented data. To fill this gap, we introduce DaQAPO - Data Quality Assessment for Process-Oriented data. It provides a set of assessment functions to identify a wide array of quality issues.

We identify two stages in the data quality assessment process:

1. Reading and preparing data;
2. Assessing the data quality - running quality tests.

If the user desires to remove anomalies detected by quality tests, he has the ability to do so.


Besides reading through this vignette, you can also run an interactive demo of `DaQAPO` in [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/). Download the course from [Github](https://github.com/nielsmartin/Introduction_to_DaQAPO).

## Data Sources

Before we can perform the first stage - reading data - we must have access to the appropriate data sources and have knowledge of the expected data structure. Our package supports two input data formats:

* __An activity log__: each line in the log represents an activity instance, i.e. the execution of an activity for a specific case (e.g. a client, a patient, a file,...) by a specific resource. Hence, an activity instance has a duration.
* __An event log__: each line in the log represents an event recorded for a specific activity instance, expressing for instance its start or its completion. Therefore, an event has no duration.

Two example datasets are included in `daqapo`. These are `hospital` and `hospital_events`. Below, you can find their respective structures.

```{r LogTypes_Activity}
str(hospital)
```
```{r LogTypes_Event}
str(hospital_events)
```


Both datasets were artificially created merely to illustrate the package's functionalities.

## Stage 1 - Read in data

First of all, data must be read and prepared such that the quality assessment tests can be executed. Data preparation requires transforming the dataset to a standardised activity log format. However, earlier we mentioned two input data formats: an activity log and an event log. When an event log is available, it needs to be converted to an activity log. `DaQAPO` provides a set of functions to assist the user in this process.


### Preparing an Activity Log

As mentioned earlier, the goal of reading and preparing data is to obtain a standardised activity log format. When your source data is already in this format, preparations come down to the following elements:

* Providing appropriate names for timestamp columns
* Applying the `POSIXct` timestamp format


For this section, the dataset `hospital` will be used to illustrate data preparations. Two main functions help the user to prepare his/her own dataset:

* `rename`
* `convert_timestamp`
* `activitylog`

#### Rename

```{r}
hospital %>%
  rename(start = start_ts,
         complete = complete_ts) -> hospital
```


#### Convert format

```{r}
hospital %>%
  convert_timestamps(c("start","complete"), format = dmy_hms) -> hospital
```


#### Create activitylog

```{r}
hospital %>%
  activitylog(case_id = "patient_visit_nr",
              activity_id = "activity",
              resource_id = "originator",
              lifecycle_ids = c("start", "complete")) -> hospital
```



### Preparing an Event Log

With event logs, things are a bit more complex. In an event log, each row represents only a part of an activity instance. Therefore, more complex data transformations must be executed and several problems could arise. In this section, we will use an event log variant of the activity log used earlier, named `hospital_events`.  three functions form the building blocks of the required data preparation:

* `convert_tiemstamps`
* `assign_instance_id`
* `check/fix_resource_inconsistencies`
* `standardize_lifecycle`
* `events_to_activitylog`

To illustrate this, we will start with only entering the dataset in the parameters of `read_event_log()`.

```{r ReadEventLog}

```

The warning informs us that column labels can also be passed in the arguments. 

```{r ReadEventLog_Cols}


```



## Stage 2 - Data Quality Assessment

The table below summarizes the different data quality assessment tests available in DaQAPO.

Table: An overview of data quality tests in DaQAPO.

To illustrate the use of these assessment functions, four functions outlined in the table above are demonstrated in the remainder of this vignette. 

### `detect_value_range_violations()`

The `detect_value_range_violations()` function checks whether the values of a passed attribute are within certain bounds for numeric attributes, or in a list of values for a character or factor attribute. For example, the triage code is typically a number between 1 and 5. We can easily test whether all cases abide to this rule.

```{r}
detect_value_range_violations(hospital, "cattr_triagecode", c(1,5))
```

Data quality assessment tests provide the user with summary statistics in the console. Also, where appropriate, they return the rows in the log that are considered to be an anomaly. In this case, you get all rows where `cattr_triagecode < 1` or `cattr_triagecode > 5`. Therefore, one can simply request the unique cases in this result to get more specific information.

```{r}
detect_value_range_violations(hospital, "cattr_triagecode", c(1,5)) %>%
  distinct(case_id, cattr_triagecode)
```

Note that the test will always print output statistics.

### `detect_duration_outliers()`

This test checks if there are any activities with a deviating duration compared to the average. The bounds of when a duration is considered to be an outlier can be customized by the user.

```{r}
detect_duration_outliers(hospital, "Clinical exam" = duration_within())
```

At this point, no outliers are detected. But say you are more sensitive to duration variance, then you can tweak the bounds by either hard-coding it or by altering the number of standard deviations used to calculate the bounds.

```{r}
detect_duration_outliers(hospital,  "Clinical exam" = duration_within(bound_sd = 2)) -> anomalies
anomalies
```

Assume that this line is entered by mistake. In that case, we can easily take the output from this assessment test to correct the hospital dataset. For this purpose, we provide you with `filter_anomalies()`.

```{r}
filter_anomalies(activity_log = hospital, anomaly_log = anomalies) -> hospital

```


### `detect_case_id_sequence_gaps()`

In our toy dataset, the case identifier is a numeric attribute. Therefore, we can check if there are any cases missing in the sequence.

```{r}
detect_case_id_sequence_gaps(hospital)
```

Note that this function can only be applied if the case numbering is unique to the business process under investigation.

### `detect_related_activities()`

Finally, we will demonstrate `detect_related_activities()`, where you can check if an activity is recorded for a case if another is present. This link is very clear between a treatment and its evaluation: a treatment can only be evaluated if a treatment was recorded in the first place.

```{r}
detect_related_activities(hospital, antecedent = "Treatment evaluation", consequent =  "Treatment")
```
