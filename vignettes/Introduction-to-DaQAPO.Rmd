## Introduction

Process mining techniques generate valuable insights in business processes using automatically generated process execution data. However, despite the extensive opportunities that process mining techniques provide, the garbage in - garbage out principle still applies. Data quality issues are widespread in real-life data and can generate misleading results when used for analysis purposes. Currently, there is no systematic way to perform data quality assessment on process-oriented data. To fill this gap, we introduce DaQAPO - Data Quality Assessment for Process-Oriented data. It provides a set of assessment functions to identify a wide array of quality issues.

We identify two stages in the data quality assessment process:

1. Reading and preparing data;
2. Assessing the data quality - running quality tests.

If the user desires to remove anomalies detected by quality tests, he has the ability to do so.

## Data Sources

Before we can perform the first stage - reading data - we must have access to the appropriate data sources and have knowledge of the expected data structure. Our package supports two input data formats:

* __An activity log__: each line in the log represents an activity instance, i.e. the execution of an activity for a specific case (e.g. a client, a patient, a file,...) by a specific resource. Hence, an activity instance has a duration.
* __An event log__: each line in the log represents an event recorded for a specific activity instance, expressing for instance its start or its completion. Therefore, an event has no duration.

Two example datasets are included in `daqapo`. These are `hospital` and `hospital_events`. Below, you can find their respective structures.

```{r LogTypes_Activity}
str(hospital)
```
```{r LogTypes_Event}
str(hospital_events)
```


Both datasets were artificially created merely to illustrate the package's functionalities.


## Stage 1 - Read in data

First of all, data must be read and prepared such that the quality assessment tests can be executed. Data preparation requires transforming the dataset to a standardised activity log format. However, earlier we mentioned two input data formats: an activity log and an event log. When an event log is available, it needs to be converted to an activity log. `daqapo` provides a set of functions, with the aid of `bupaR`, to assist the user in this process.


### Preparing an Activity Log

As mentioned earlier, the goal of reading and preparing data is to obtain a standardised activity log format. When your source data is already in this format, preparations come down to the following elements:

* Providing appropriate names for timestamp columns
* Applying the `POSIXct` timestamp format
* Creating the activity log object.


For this section, the dataset `hospital` will be used to illustrate data preparations. Three main functions help the user to prepare his/her own dataset:

* `rename`
* `convert_timestamp`
* `activitylog`

#### Rename

The activity log object adds a mapping to the data frame to link each column with its specific meaning. In this regard, the timestamp columns each represent a different lifecycle state. `daqapo` must know which column is which, requiring standardised timestamp names. The accepted timestamp values are:

* schedule
* assign
* reassign
* start
* suspend
* resume
* abort_activity
* abort_case
* complete
* manualskip
* autoskip

The two timestamps required by `daqapo` are start and complete.

```{r rename}
hospital %>%
  rename(start = start_ts,
         complete = complete_ts) -> hospital
```


#### Convert timestamp format

Each timestamp must also be in the `POSIXct` format.

```{r convert_timestamps}
hospital %>%
  convert_timestamps(c("start","complete"), format = dmy_hms) -> hospital
```


#### Create activitylog

When the timestamps are edited to the desired format, the activity log object can be created along with the required mapping.

```{r create_activitylog}
hospital %>%
  activitylog(case_id = "patient_visit_nr",
              activity_id = "activity",
              resource_id = "originator",
              lifecycle_ids = c("start", "complete")) -> hospital
```



### Preparing an Event Log

With event logs, things are a bit more complex. In an event log, each row represents only a part of an activity instance. Therefore, more complex data transformations must be executed and several problems could arise. In this section, we will use an event log variant of the activity log used earlier, named `hospital_events`.

```{r ReadEventLog}
hospital_events
```

The same principle regarding the timestamps apply. Therefore, the `POSIXct` format must be applied in advance. Additionally, the event log object also requires an activity instance id. If needed, one can be created manually as illustrated below.

The following functions form the building blocks of the required data preparation, but not all must be called to obtain a fully prepared event log at all times:

* `convert_timestamps`
* `assign_instance_id`
* `check/fix_resource_inconsistencies`
* `standardize_lifecycle`
* `events_to_activitylog`


```{r ReadEventLog_Cols}
hospital_events %>%
  convert_timestamps(c("timestamp"), format = dmy_hms) %>%
  mutate(event_matching = paste(patient_visit_nr, activity, event_matching)) %>%
  events_to_activitylog(case_id = "patient_visit_nr", 
                        activity_id = "activity", 
                        activity_instance_id = "event_matching", 
                        timestamp = "timestamp", 
                        resource_id = "originator",
                        lifecycle_id = "event_lifecycle_state") -> hospital_events

```
